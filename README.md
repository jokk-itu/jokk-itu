Welcome to my page!

My profile is filled with fun hobby projects, simply trying to learn new technologies,
where as others are serious projects meant to be used.

My main interest is architecture and distributed systems, with all of the trouble it brings.
I research a lot in different architectures.
I also research identity management and authorization, specifically OAuth and its extension OpenId Connect.
